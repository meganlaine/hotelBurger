## Welcome! 

We've chosen to present the CLI and GUI versions of our program separately.

The hotel has pre-existing reservations to work with
(some sample guests are ‘Fields’ and ‘Folds’).


#### To run the CLI version:
* Download the __VeganBurger__ branch: <https://github.com/meganlaine/hotelBurger/tree/VeganBurger>
* Run the '''main''' method in the '''Main''' class
* To exit the CLI: (press 9) from the main menu. 
    * This also saves the state of our hotel on every exit by overwriting the '''HotelBurgerReservations.txt''' file, which we use to populate the hotel on start up.


#### To run the GUI version:
* Download the __LeanBurger__ branch: <https://github.com/meganlaine/hotelBurger/tree/LeanBurger>
* Run the '''main''' method in the '''Starter''' class.


#### Text files needed:
- [x] '''HotelBurgerRooms.txt''': stores hotel information and room information
- [x] '''HotelBurgerReservations.txt''': stores existing reservations, 
and is the same file that reservations are saved to.
- [x] '''testfilehotelrooms.txt''': for unit testing. Stores hotel info and rooms used in the test() method in class Hotel. *Do not change it*.
- [x] '''testfilehotelreservations.txt''': for unit testing. Stores hotel reservations used in the test() method in class Hotel. *Do not change it*.
