## Welcome! 

We've chosen to present the CLI and GUI versions of our program separately.

The hotel has pre-existing reservations to work with
(some sample guests are ‘Fields’ and ‘Folds’).


#### To run the CLI version:
* Download the __VeganBurger__ branch: <https://github.com/meganlaine/hotelBurger/tree/VeganBurger>
* Run the *main* method in the *Main* class
* To exit the CLI: (press 9) from the main menu. 
    * This also saves the state of our hotel on every exit by overwriting the *HotelBurgerReservations.txt* file, which we use to populate the hotel on start up.


#### To run the GUI version:
* Download the __LeanBurger__ branch: <https://github.com/meganlaine/hotelBurger/tree/LeanBurger>
* Run the *main* method in the *Starter* class.


#### Text files needed:
- [x] *HotelBurgerRooms.txt*: stores hotel information and room information
- [x] *HotelBurgerReservations.txt*: stores existing reservations, 
and is the same file that reservations are saved to.
- [x] *testfilehotelrooms.txt*: for unit testing. Stores hotel info and rooms used in the test() method in class Hotel. *__Do not change it__*.
- [x] *testfilehotelreservations.txt*: for unit testing. Stores hotel reservations used in the test() method in class Hotel. *__Do not change it__*.

### Hotel Burger is open for business! :bowtie:
