PROJECT TITLE: Hotel Burger
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: A hotel reservation software program.
VERSION or DATE: 1/29/2019, VeganBurger
AUTHORS: Dale Berg, Steven Liu, Megan Laine, Nick Coyle

Welcome! 

For simplicity and clarity, we've chosen to present the CLI and GUI versions of our program seperately.

The hotel has pre-existing reservations to work with (some sample guests are ‘Fields’ and ‘Folds’).


To run the CLI version:
-----------------
-- Download the VeganBurger branch
-- Run the main method in the Main class
-- To exit the CLI: (press 9) from the main menu. This also saves the state of our hotel on every exit by overwriting the HotelBurgerReservations.txt file which we use to populate the hotel on start up.


To run the GUI version:
-----------------
-- Download the LeanBurger branch
-- Run the main method in the Starter class.


Text files needed:
-----------------
--hotelrooms.txt: stores hotel information and room information
--HotelBurgerReservations.txt: stores existing reservations, and is the same file that reservations are saved to.

--hotelrooms.txt???
--output.txt???


Burger Hotel is open for business!
