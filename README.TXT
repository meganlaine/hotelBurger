PROJECT TITLE: HotelBurger
PURPOSE OF PROJECT: To practice group work designing a system
VERSION or DATE: 1/22/2019
AUTHORS: Dale Berg, Steven Liu, Megan Laine, Nick Coyle


Welcome to our CSC143 Hotel project. To run the console i/o program, simply run the main method in the Main class from your development environment. This will launch a console window which will prompt you to make selections from a menu. For certain methods, such as looking up a reservation or info on a certain guest, you will be prompted to enter a last name. We’ve pre-loaded some names into the program for you - try typing in ‘Fields’ or ‘Folds’ whenever you are prompted to enter a name. 

The menu system is built on a loop, so the program will continue running until you exit (by pressing 9) from the main menu. At the conclusion of every procedure or sub menu you will see a prompt to return to the main menu by pressing 0. The only way to exit the program is by entering ‘9’ in the main menu. This saves the state of our hotel on every exit by overwriting the .txt file which we use to populate the hotel on start up. 

In addition to our text based console i/o program, we’ve built an interactive GUI version of the program. *****

For simplicity and clarity, we've chosen to present the GUI and text based console versions program seperately. The only difference between the programs is their method of presentation - the objects they utilize are identical otherwise. 

Burger Hotel is open for business.
